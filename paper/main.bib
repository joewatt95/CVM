abstract="One of the main challenges in the analysis of probabilistic programs is to compute invariant properties that summarise loop behaviours. Automation of invariant generation is still at its infancy and most of the times targets only expected values of the program variables, which is insufficient to recover the full probabilistic program behaviour. We present a method to automatically generate moment-based invariants of a subclass of probabilistic programs, called Prob-solvable loops, with polynomial assignments over random variables and parametrised distributions. We combine methods from symbolic summation and statistics to derive invariants as valid properties over higher-order moments, such as expected values or variances, of program variables. We successfully evaluated our work on several examples where full automation for computing higher-order moments and invariants over program variables was not yet possible.",

  abstract = { The sumcheck protocol, introduced in 1992, is an interactive proof which is a key component of many probabilistic proof systems in computational complexity theory and cryptography, some of which have been deployed. However, none of these proof systems based on the sumcheck protocol enjoy a formally-verified security analysis. In this paper, we make progress in this direction by providing a formally verified security analysis of the sumcheck protocol using the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. We follow a general and modular approach. First, we give a general formalization of public-coin interactive proofs. We then define a generalized sumcheck protocol for which we axiomatize the underlying mathematical structure and we establish its soundness and completeness. Finally, we prove that these axioms hold for multivariate polynomials, the original setting of the sumcheck protocol. Our modular analysis facilitates formal verification of sumcheck instances based on different mathematical structures with little effort, by simply proving that these structures satisfy the axioms. Moreover, the analysis supports the development and formal verification of future cryptographic protocols using the sumcheck protocol as a building block. },

This problem has applications to query optimization, Internet routing, network topology, and data mining. For a stream of indices in {1,...,n}, our algorithm computes a (1 ± ε)-approximation using an optimal O(1/ε-2 + log(n)) bits of space with 2/3 success probability, where 0&lt;ε&lt;1 is given. This probability can be amplified by independent repetition. Furthermore, our algorithm processes each stream update in O(1) worst-case time, and can report an estimate at any point midstream in O(1) worst-case time, thus settling both the space and time complexities simultaneously.We also give an algorithm to estimate the Hamming norm of a stream, a generalization of the number of distinct elements, which is useful in data cleaning, packet tracing, and database auditing. Our algorithm uses nearly optimal space, and has optimal O(1) update and reporting times.},

  abstract = {Estimating the cardinality (number of distinct elements) of a large multiset is a classic problem in streaming and sketching, dating back to Flajolet and Martin’s classic Probabilistic Counting (PCSA) algorithm from 1983. In this paper we study the intrinsic tradeoff between the space complexity of the sketch and its estimation error in the random oracle model. We define a new measure of efficiency for cardinality estimators called the Fisher-Shannon (Fish) number H/I. It captures the tension between the limiting Shannon entropy (H) of the sketch and its normalized Fisher information (I), which characterizes the variance of a statistically efficient, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our results are as follows. (i) We prove that all base-q variants of Flajolet and Martin’s PCSA sketch have Fish-number H0/I0 ≈ 1.98016 and that every base-q variant of (Hyper)LogLog has Fish-number worse than H0/I0, but that they tend to H0/I0 in the limit as q→ ∞. Here H0,I0 are precisely defined constants. (ii) We describe a sketch called Fishmonger that is based on a smoothed, entropy-compressed variant of PCSA with a different estimator function. It is proved that with high probability, Fishmonger processes a multiset of [U] such that at all times, its space is O(log2logU) + (1+o(1))(H0/I0)b ≈ 1.98b bits and its standard error is 1/√b. (iii) We give circumstantial evidence that H0/I0 is the optimum Fish-number of mergeable sketches for Cardinality Estimation. We define a class of linearizable sketches and prove that no member of this class can beat H0/I0. The popular mergeable sketches are, in fact, also linearizable.},

  abstract="Approximate model counting is the task of approximating the number of solutions to an input Boolean formula. The state-of-the-art approximate model counter for formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF), {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf{\{}ApproxMC{\}}{\$}{\$}ApproxMC, provides a scalable means of obtaining model counts with probably approximately correct (PAC)-style guarantees. Nevertheless, the validity of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf{\{}ApproxMC{\}}{\$}{\$}ApproxMC's approximation relies on a careful theoretical analysis of its randomized algorithm and the correctness of its highly optimized implementation, especially the latter's stateful interactions with an incremental CNF satisfiability solver capable of natively handling parity (XOR) constraints.",

  abstract="We present a method to automatically approximate moment-based invariants of probabilistic programs with non-polynomial updates of continuous state variables to accommodate more complex dynamics. Our approach leverages polynomial chaos expansion to approximate non-linear functional updates as sums of orthogonal polynomials. We exploit this result to automatically estimate state-variable moments of all orders in Prob-solvable loops with non-polynomial updates. We showcase the accuracy of our estimation approach in several examples, such as the turning vehicle model and the Taylor rule in monetary policy.",
