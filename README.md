# Verification of the CVM algorithm

This repository formalises and verifies the
[CVM algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10191)
in the [Isabelle proof assistant](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/),
as presented in the [ITP 2025](https://icetcs.github.io/frocos-itp-tableaux25/itp/)
paper "Verification of the CVM algorithm with a Functional Probabilistic Invariant".
